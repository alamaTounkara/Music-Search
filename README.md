# Music-Search

Native-app based application to serve as a basic music search app.

This app was implemented and tested in android studio on android M, Lollipop, and pre-Lollipop.

I used Retrofit as the REST client, but i could have also used Volley, OkHttp, Asynctask and so on...

I used Picasso for loading and caching the image.
